This is a hobby project that aims to use a bunch of different languages, APIs and libraries to visualize a food tour of Pune. The food tour is a specific case of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and I'll try to use different algorithms to find the quickest route. 

Contents:
1) A python file index.py which runs over the Excel sheet containing the location data of the different points on the trip.
2) An Excel sheet data.xlsx that holds location data.
3) An HTML/CSS/JavaScript file index.html that visualizes the results using the appropriate libraries.
